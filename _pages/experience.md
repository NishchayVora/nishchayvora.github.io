##### Neuromatch Academy 
*July 2020* 

The [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/) was a summer school where we were trained on learning computational tools and apply them to real-life neuroscience research problems. Some of the topics which interested me the most were dynanimcal networks, bayesian statistics, and optimal control. We would also carry out a group project based on real-world neuroscience datasets, and be mentored by an expert in the field.
