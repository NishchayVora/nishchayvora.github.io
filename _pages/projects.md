##### **Inferring neuronal computation from partial observations**
*Feb 2022 - Present* 

*Allen Institute of Brain Sciences, Seattle*

I am working under [Prof. Kaspar Podgorski](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/kaspar-podgorski/) where I am exploring ways to infer a neuronâ€™s computations from partial observations of its inputs and outputs. I am looking into simulating neurons as hierarchical linear-nonlinear models under a variety of conditions and inferring the parameters of the simulated neuron using gradient descent methods with PyTorch.

##### **Investigating the physiology of aging across mouse population**
*Aug 2021 - Jan 2022* 

*EPFL, Switzerland*

I worked under [Prof. Johan Auwerx](https://people.epfl.ch/johan.auwerx?lang=en) and worked on analysing biological timeseries data with machine learning and computational modelling. I explored ways to analyze timeseries across genetically diverse mice populations and looked into methods to create a health index to summarize aging properties across the population.

##### **Automating cloud instance health checks and maintenance**
*May 2021 - July 2021* 

*ServiceNow, Hyderabad, India*

I worked as a software development intern in the cloud computing and development operations (DevOps) team on a proprietary cloud infrastructure platform for monitoring the health of cloud instances and load balancing.

##### **Modelling biological networks using formal language**
*Aug 2020 - Dec 2020* 

*Department of Computer Science, BITS Pilani*

I worked under [Prof. Rajesh Kumar](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rajeshk/profile) where I explored ways to analyze biological networks such as gene regulatory networks (GRNs), with the help of formal language and automata theory. Specifically, we worked on the fault analysis of GRNs to understand the effect of induced drugs and modelling stochasticity in GRNs using probabilistic boolean networks.

##### **Prediction of coronary heart disease with data mining and machine learning**
*Aug 2020 - Dec 2020* 

*Department of Biological Sciences, BITS Pilani*

I worked under [Prof. Syamantak Majumder](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/syamantakmajumder/profile) to understand the biological paramaters influencing heart diseases with machine learning, using data from hospital patients. I worked on comparing various machine learning and deep learning models for their best performance on the task.

##### **Analysis of the neural patterns betweeen face and shape recognition**
*Neuromatch Academy*

*July 2020* 

The [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/) was a summer school where we were trained on learning computational tools and apply them to real-life neuroscience research problems. Some of the topics which interested me the most were dynanimcal networks, bayesian statistics, and optimal control. As part of the group project, we worked on the [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases) dataset, where we analysed the neural patterns between face and shape recognition in the brain.

##### **Protein engineering with deep learning**
*RWTH Aachen University, Germany*

*May - July 2020*

I worked as a research intern at the [Institute of Biotechnology](https://www.biotec.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~imne/BIOTEC/lidx/1/) under Prof. Mehdi D. Davari. I worked on the prediction of biophysical properties of enzymes created through directed evoultion, a process mimicking natural selection. I experimented with various machine learning and deep learning models for choosing the best performing model for the required task, and analyzed high throughput data for protein mutation samples.

##### **Machine learning for cancer prognosis using biomedical image data**
*Department of Biological Sciences, BITS Pilani*

*May - July 2020*

I worked under [Prof. Meghana Tare](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/meghanatare/profile) to analyze biomedical image samples with machine learning and deep learning models. I performed biomedical image segmentation with the help of convolutional neural networks, and classified the MR images using the 3-D voxel data.

##### **Custom JupyterHub AWS instance with automated load balancing using Kubernetes**
*UST Global, Trivandrum, India*

*May - July 2019*

I worked as a software development intern at the research center of the company, Infinity Labs. I worked on developing a proof of concept AWS JupyterHub cluster using Kubernetes for internal company resources to explore and prototype machine learning models without local installation and dependices. I also worked on automating the load management for each user's instance, along with a custom login protocol based on an internal authentication method of the organization.
