Hi! I am Nishchay, I am currently pursuing M1 in [Paris Physics Master](http://www.parisphysicsmaster.com/home.html){:target="\_blank"} at [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/){:target="\_blank"} and [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/){:target="\_blank"}. 

I am a [SMARTS-UP](https://mobility.smarts-up.fr/){:target="\_blank"} excellence scholarship holder, and I have completed double majors in (B.E.) Mechanical and (M.Sc.) Physics from [BITS Pilani, India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of particle physics and cosmology. I'm excited about exploring particle interactions in the early universe, extensions of the standard model, and also modified theories of gravity.

<!-- Thesis at Allen -->
Last year, I was involved in a research project under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Gariazzo at the [Insitute Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare - Sezione da Torino](https://www.to.infn.it/), where I developed a fast calculation of the effective number of cosmological neutrinos in the early universe.

<!-- Thesis at EPFL -->
<!-- Recently, I worked on my Master's thesis at INFN, Turin studying non-instantaneous neutrino decoupling and calculating distortions in neutrino distributions due to electron-positron annihilation. -->

<!-- NMA TAs -->

<!-- I most recently parcipated at the [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a summer school on computational neuroscience. I worked on various computational tools and their applications for real-world neuroscience problems. 
I also worked on the [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases) dataset to analyze neural patterns in face and shape recognition in the human brain.

I previously worked at the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1) as a research intern analyzing protein engineering techniques using machine learning tools. Specifically, I explored directed evolution, a method of selection based on natural evolution to filter specific biophysical properties of the proteins. -->
