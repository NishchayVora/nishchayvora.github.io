Hi! I am Nishchay, and currently pursuing double majors in (B.E.) Computer Science and (M.Sc.) Biological Sciences from [BITS Pilani, India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}.


My research interest lies at the intersection of biology and computer science. I'm exploring machine learning, deep learning, computational neuroscience, computational biology and bioinformatics. 

<!-- Thesis at Allen -->
I'm currently pursuing my master's thesis at the [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org/), Seattle where I'm working on inferring neuronal computations from partially observing its inputs and outputs. 

<!-- Thesis at EPFL -->
Recently, I worked on my bachelor's thesis at [EPFL, Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/) under Prof. Johan Auwerx where I worked on analysing biological timeseries data with machine learning to investigate aging across mice populations. 

<!-- NMA TAs -->

<!-- I most recently parcipated at the [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a summer school on computational neuroscience. I worked on various computational tools and their applications for real-world neuroscience problems. 
I also worked on the [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases) dataset to analyze neural patterns in face and shape recognition in the human brain.

I previously worked at the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1) as a research intern analyzing protein engineering techniques using machine learning tools. Specifically, I explored directed evolution, a method of selection based on natural evolution to filter specific biophysical properties of the proteins. -->
